        <p>Dogs4Days has a mission of saving many dogs from abused homes and that are homeless. 
            <br>There are many dogs that are being mistreated and homeless that Dogs4Days are saving. We work with building trust back in dogs with
            <br> training and special treatment. We have events to show off some of the dogs that are ready to be adopted. </p>
        <p>We provide great shelter, food, shots, and toys! We go to events for people to look at the dogs, 
            <br>if anyone has interest in a specific dog we will do a background check,
            <br> making sure that are dogs are going to great homes. </p>
        </div>
        <p class="anotherflag">We have local supporters who donate toys, kennels, food, and anything that will help provide for the dogs. 
            <br>Here at Dogs4Days we take the best care of the dogs with all of the proper training. 
            <br>Getting them ready to go to a forever home. </p>
